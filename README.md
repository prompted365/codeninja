## 🚀 What is CodeNinja?

Born in a garage in **Encinitas, California** 🌴, CodeNinja is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that gives AI assistants like Claude supernatural powers over n8n workflows. 

**Translation:** You can literally talk to Claude and build complex automations by just describing what you want. No more clicking through UIs like a peasant.

```
You: "Yo CodeNinja, build me a workflow that monitors crypto prices and texts me when Bitcoin moons"
CodeNinja: "Say no more fam" *creates entire workflow in 2.3 seconds*
```

## 🌴 The Encinitas Story

Built in a garage with views of the Pacific, fueled by California burritos and the dream of making automation accessible to everyone. We believe workflows should be as easy to create as ordering fish tacos at Lolita's.

**Why CodeNinja?** Because clicking through UI buttons is for tourists. Real locals speak their automations into existence.
